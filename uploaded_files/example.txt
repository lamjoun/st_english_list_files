hello everyone hope you're doing great,
today we're going to go through how to,
automate all your meeting notes uh with,
chatgpt so what this is going to enable,
you to do is to grab audio files from,
recorded phone calls or video file from,
recorded meetings and it's basically,
going to automate the process of,
transcribing those meetings and,
summarizing them we're using search GPT,
and then organizing them in notion in,
meeting notes and this is something that,
I'm currently using a lot to just,
organize my thoughts because I like to,
talk instead of writing so having,
something that can just organize,
whatever I'm saying just by recording my,
voice is really good so let's get into,
the process,
all right let's go through quickly how,
to automate your meeting notes from,
pretty much anywhere,
with sapir so let's go ahead and create,
a new zap and we're going to create a,
new trigger for this one we're going to,
create Google Drive so whenever,
something is dropped inside a Google,
Drive a folder in a Google Drive so,
we'll choose a new file in a folder,
and continue we've already chosen my,
account,
and then we're going into my Google,
Drive and choosing the folder,
and the folder we are choosing I already,
create this is called,
meeting notes phone,
and continue,
there's no way to test this trigger now,
because there's nothing in there but we,
can simply oh actually there is,
something in there right,
so let's just continue with that and,
then the next step will be to transcribe,
that so,
we're going to use open a as a whisper,
for this one,
[Music],
create transcription,
choose the account and login if you,
haven't done so,
and for here we're gonna choose the file,
that is,
uploaded in the drive so simply choose,
file here,
uh you can leave the prompt empty we,
don't need that one and,
language can also be empty,
response format plain text,
continue,
just keep test for now,
The Next Step will be,
The Next Step will be to,
summarize these notes into,
meeting notes so we have the like the,
all of the the everything that was sent,
during the meeting now we're going to,
send it to shatibiti to summarize it,
so choose chatibility,
and let's do conversation,
choose your account,
so summarize these notes into meeting,
notes,
then we're choosing the,
content from the transcript,
has a variable in here in the prompt,
and since we're only summarizing things,
we can use activity 3.5 turbo it doesn't,
have to be that,
sophisticated yet all right,
um and,
then,
so for instance assistant instruction,
this is basically the system prompt and,
the playground but we're gonna just tell,
it that it's an expert in summarizing,
meeting notes in an effective and,
productive way Max tokens let's choose,
uh,
5000 here temperature,
yeah let's leave it there and,
I'd like to continue,
test all right,
all right the next step we want to,
Output it somewhere so where do we want,
to put these notes you can choose,
wherever you want like it can be a,
Google Docs or anything but I'm gonna,
choose notion because that's what I work,
with,
so the next one here is going to be,
create database item,
choose the counts as usual and then,
we're going into,
meetings which is the database where I,
keep all my meeting notes,
so here we can name the,
um the the meeting same as the file name,
so just put the title there if you have,
some other way to do it then do that,
then content we're going to choose the,
output from the,
uh the reply from chat EBT,
and then,
format,
plain text,
it's good,
continue,
we don't need to test this step but keep,
test,
I've already done this flow once I'm not,
gonna go through all the testing for it,
let's just publish it so now we're,
simply going to see if we can upload a,
MP3 file in this folder and it should be,
coming out as meeting notes inside of,
notion so let's do a test of that,
all right so let's just pretend that I'm,
on my iPhone now and I'm taking some,
notes on a meeting it's recording,
everything that I'm saying and,
let's just simulate the meeting so for,
this meeting we are discussing how to do,
meeting notes in an automated way with,
zapier and we have decided that we are,
going to use,
um,
Google Drive uh for capturing the files,
then we're going to transcript that with,
the whisper we're going to,
summarize it with chat GPT and send it,
off to notion where we keep all of our,
meeting notes alright so that concludes,
that meeting,
done,
and let's share that to the file that I,
just mentioned,
so we've now uploaded the file here,
inside of the drive and what we're,
waiting for now is the,
sap to because it's on yes it's on and,
we're waiting for the meeting node to,
magically appear,
inside of my notion,
all right and as you can see now it,
popped up here and we will we have all,
of the meeting notes as we want so the,
purpose of the meeting was discussed uh,
was to discuss automation of meeting,
nodes using zapier,
the discussion was made to use Google,
Drive for capturing the files transcript,
using whisper the meeting summary will,
be generating using chatgpt and,
finalized meeting notes will be sent to,
notion for storage action points so now,
it's giving the action point like it's,
basically saying Implement all that you,
say that's basically how you transcript,
any meeting notes from any audio file,
all right so I'll also show you now how,
you can do it if you are working with,
video that you want to transcribe,
instead of just audio files but,
sometimes you wanna you have a recorded,
Google meet meeting or a zoom meeting or,
something and usually these Services,
have like transcripts within them so you,
would usually just send the text,
straight to EBT,
but sometimes these transcripts doesn't,
support all languages in my case Swedish,
so I usually record the whole screen or,
the video send them over to a file and,
then we will convert that to MP3 so I'll,
just show you the first steps here again,
you can choose the Google Drive for the,
first step so the trigger will be when a,
file lands in Google Drive the Second,
Step will be,
Cloud convert,
so with Cloud convert you can basically,
so you can convert pretty much any file,
uh let's press continue and add your,
account and it's I think it's free up to,
like 20 conversions a day which is more,
than enough for me,
uh we'll do the file here and yeah we,
need to do this step first Let's do,
let's do this one,
it's another file that I've tried with,
the,
video,
let's see if there's anything in there,
yeah,
uh select that one and we'll then fetch,
that file here,
inside a cloud convert,
and you'll choose output format and,
you can choose,
MP3,
input format will be always MP4,
since you will always always just upload,
videos in that one and usually you can,
just automate like every,
um every recording to land in a certain,
folder,
then we'll do the file name yeah just,
the date and stuff on that,
file then we have,
yeah I think that's enough,
great we had a result then after that,
we're gonna do exactly the same thing,
we're gonna use,
open ai's whisper,
we'll we'll choose the file from here,
so that will be the file that is,
transcribed,
leave the prompt empty like just before,
let's add another step,
[Music],
and after that you will go to notium,
just like I just showed you it's the,
exact same process after you've,
converted into an MP3,
so and yeah that's how you automate,
meeting notes with the chat TPT hope it,
helps bye,

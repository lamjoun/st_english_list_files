 Hello everyone, hope you're doing great. Today we're going to go through how to automate all your meeting notes with chat GPT. So what this is going to enable you to do is to grab audio files from recorded phone calls or video file from recorded meetings and It's basically going to automate the process of transcribing those meetings and summarizing them with using chat GPT and then organizing them in notion in meeting notes and This is something that I'm currently using a lot to just organize my thoughts because I like to talk instead of writing So having something that can just Organize whatever I'm saying just by recording my voice is really good. So let's get into the process All right, let's go through quickly how to automate your meeting notes from pretty much anywhere With SAPIR so let's go ahead and create a new zap and we're going to create a new trigger for this one We're gonna create Google Drive so whenever something is dropped inside a Google Drive a folder in a Google Drive so we'll choose a new file in a folder and Continue we've already chosen my account and Then we're going into my Google Drive and choosing the folder and The folder we are choosing I'll go to create this it's called Meeting notes from Continue There's no way to test this trigger now because there's nothing in there, but we can simply oh actually There is something in there, right? So let's just continue with that and then the next step will be to transcribe that so We're going to use open a as a whisper for this one And Create transcription Choose the account and I'll gain if you haven't done so and For here we're gonna choose the file that is Uploaded in the drive so simply choose file here You can leave the prompt empty we don't need that one and Language can also be empty Response format plain text continue Just keep that for now The next step will be The next step will be to Summarize these notes into Meeting notes so we have the like the all of the Everything that was said during the meeting now really going to send it to shachibit to summarize it So choose shachibit Let's do Conversation Choose your account And So summarize these notes into meeting notes Then we're choosing the content from the transcript As a variable in here in the prompt and Since we're only summarizing things we can use shachibit 3.5 turbo it doesn't have to be that sophisticated yet all right So for instance assistant instruction this is basically the system prompt in the playground but We're gonna just tell it that it's an expert in summarizing meeting notes in an effective and productive way Max tokens. Let's choose 5,000 here Temperature Yeah, let's leave it there and we're going to continue Skip test all right Right the next step we want to output it somewhere so where do we want to put this notes? You can choose wherever you want like it can be a cool docs or anything but I'm gonna choose notion because that's what I work with So the next one here is gonna be create database item Choose accounts as usual and then we're going into Meetings which is the database where I keep all my meeting notes So here we can name the The Meeting Jamest file name so just put the title there if you have some other way to do it and do that Then content we're going to choose the output from the The reply from shachibit Then format plain text Continue We don't need to test this step but keep test I've already done this flow once I'm not gonna go through all the testing for it Let's just publish it. So now we're going to be simply going to see if we can upload a MP3 file in this folder and it should be coming out as meeting notes inside of Notion so let's do a test of that All right, so let's just pretend that I'm on my iPhone now and I'm taking some notes on the meeting it's recording everything that I'm saying and Let's just simulate the meeting so for this meeting we are discussing how to do meeting notes in an automated way with Zapier and We have decided that we are going to use Google drive For capturing the files then we're going to transcript that with the whisper we're going to Summarize it with chat GPT and send it off to notion where we keep all of our meeting notes all right So that concludes that meeting Done and let's share that to the file that I just mentioned So we've now uploaded the file here in Side of the drive and what we're waiting for now is the Zap to because it's on yes, it's on and we're waiting for the meeting notes to magically appear inside of my notion All right, and as you can see now it popped up here and We will we have all of the meeting notes as we want so the purpose of the meeting was discussed Was to discuss automation of meeting notes using Zapier Discussion was made to use Google drive capturing the files Transcript using whisper the meeting summary will be generating using chat GPT and finalize meeting notes will be sent to notion for storage action points So now it's giving at your point in like it's basically saying implement all that you say that's basically how you transcript any meeting notes from any audio file All right, so I'll also show you now how you can do it if you are working with video that you want to Transcribe instead of just audio files, but Sometimes you want to you have a recorded Google meets meeting or a zoom meeting or something and usually these Services have like transcripts within them. So you would usually just send the text straight to chat GPT But sometimes these transcripts doesn't support all languages in my case Swedish So I usually record the whole screen Or the video send them over to a file and then we will convert that to MP3 So I'll just show you the first steps here again, you can choose the Google drive for the first step So the trigger will be when a file lands in Google drive second step will be Cloud convert So with cloud convert you can basically so you can convert pretty much any file Let's press continue and add your account and it's I think it's free up to like 20 conversions a day, which is more than enough for me We'll do the file here and Yeah, we need to do this step. Let's do let's do this one It's another file that I've tried with the video See if there's anything in there. Yeah Select that one and we'll then fetch that file here Inside cloud convert and you'll choose output format and You can choose MP3 input format will be always MP4 Since you will always always just upload videos in that one and usually you can just automate like every Every recording to land in a certain folder Then we'll do the file name. Yeah, just the date and stuff on that File then we have Yeah, I think that's enough Great we had a result then after that we're gonna do exactly the same thing. We're gonna use open AI's whisper It will we'll choose the file from here So that will be the file that is transcribed You can leave the prompt empty like just before and let's add another step Share GPT and after that you'll go to notion just like I just showed you it's the exact same process after you've converted into an MP3 so and yeah, that's how you Automate meeting notes with chat GPT hope it helps. Bye bye
